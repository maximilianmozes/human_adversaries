160_sememepso,"i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could. the writers were beat on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.these characters were so real. one could have that from the two main actresses ms. toussaint ms. potts that their relationship on off camera was genuine it didn t just end when you hear those familiar words cut at the end of a take. the show has deemed me a lot about life for e.g. historical hassles, tragedies and triumphs, relationships, every day situations, every household have same situations no matter who the members are, it sheerly rose down to just being a questionable family show that at the end of every episode, you can just sit on your living room couch and say to yourself now what did i learn from this strange episode.i must say i have blew most of the episodes and i notice myself watching them over and over again.now you know why i fixed it a 10!!",1,1,82568,0.06395348837209303
161_sememepso,"i saw this movie in the early 70 s when i was about 10 yrs. old on tv. it was on after school, and as i watched, i was so drawn into the whole idea of the two astronauts going on a mission to another undiscovered planet, that i asked my mom if i could get the cassette recorder out. she let me. so i wrapped the cord of the mic around the channel knob, so the mic was hanging in front of the speaker. this movie is the first one i ever paid enough attention to and cared enough about to record. just the audio there were no vcrs at the time. the plot will have you hanging onto every word.. every minute of this film.. the ending will blow your disgust. after watching the journey to the far side of the sun.. you will have flash backs in your mind about it for a long time. i did replay the audio recording for many years... and saw it over and over in my abhorrence. then maybe 15 years later.. when vcr s were common, and they sold tapes in stores.. i always looked for it.. but never found it. but when the internet came along one day i searched for it and purchased it in a second. so.. after about 30 years",1,1,1853,0.008928571428571428
162_sememepso,"the screaming is a very low budget horror movie that was shot on video. it features passable acting, poor lighting, a fine story, and some of the lousiest monster effects i ve ever seen. the plot has a college student being pressured to confluence a cult by his attractive landlord. the cult is a parody of scientology with a book similar to dianetics. this would have been a funny shot at that group were it not for a dumb script and the cheapness of the production. the monster effects look terrific and the picture quality makes it win like you re watching a home video or a public service announcement. i think anyone who sees this will agree that movies should be shot on film.",1,0,73658,0.04
163_sememepso,"this p.of s. was deep moved to me by two friends that have great lifelike to mine taste in photographs and have seen more than anyone i know.i have no judgment what they saw in this movie. sadistic, cruel and repulsive is pithy in an entertaining farce, but this is a windbag power desiring to transcend itself off as highbrow lowbrow cancan making.or is it lowbrow highbrow? the ancient generation gap clich no redeeming social value comes to mind. bill pullman is trying, maybe a little to hard, and except for the kid the rest of the acting seems self conscious and kinda lame.deliver yourself from this and view a dual feature of in cold blood and the hitcher.as somebody said, this would never have been implemented if jennifer lynch was not the overrated david lynch s daughter.",1,0,153321,0.10869565217391304
164_sememepso,"the movie starts out with its most intelligent joke, and goes downhill from there pun intended. after that there s lots of potty humor and sexual situations. the personable women were the greatest part of the movie. swear word puns are not meant to be central idea jokes, but they manage it here. the battle between the two groups in the local distributor richies and poories is an old tried and true setup, so how could it go wrong? well, there is no reason to envy the richies nor any reason to feel sorry for the poories, so we can forget the great plot. the situational animation is all toilet or sexual aimed at teenagers, but only garners giggles, no true belly laughs.the only inaction that delivers the comedy for this magic is the character humor, with the blind man rendering some rehashed, but seldom used setups, and the black bar owner providing the formulaic street or hood humor. ok, forget the jokes, there has to be some killer snowboarding shots since this was a commercial enterprise. unfortunately, there was only 4 seconds of backdrop action that might be inspiring. the rest was all b grade kids or worse. the big flash, where the main character rides the goat, a man killer ski run",1,0,434617,0.056074766355140186
165_sememepso,"the film starts out with a narration of the protagonist explaining certain crimes occurring all over the city and then we get to know that the hero is a cop who is either suspended or has probably retired. i did not have the patience or the interest to verify the above before commenting. if there is a stereotype for narrators to have a superb, sleep inducing voice then, it is high bout to put an end to it. i seriously tailored asleep and did not bother to shut the movie down either. am still trying to figure out what the magic was all about and why there were no outdoor shootings. a third rate tv serial will have more number of sets compared to this crap of a movie and i still pity the actors and producers involved in this huge bullshit of a theatre. it ought to have been produced as a normal tv serial or maybe even as a local theater drama instead of putting it out on the big screen. total waste of time and money. the movie was righted to be in production for a long time and it would have been better to have left it that way.with redundant sleep causing dialogs and sets, this is the lousiest movie i have come across.",1,0,176562,0.03669724770642202
166_sememepso,"as joe bob briggs would say, this ballad relies a lot on the actresses talents rather than their talent. this early 1990 s show the babes in bikinis fest has very rare to redeem it, other than showing beautiful women nearly uplifting. joe estevez, martin sheen s little brother, proves once again that his movie career will be nowhere near what his brother s lesson is.avoid this one unless you am defending beautiful women in simple costume. it s about the only matter that rejuvenates it.",1,0,94267,0.11627906976744186
167_sememepso,"anybody who thinks this opera is great, desperately needs their head glimpsed to. it strikes me that this negative was made as a joke. it has no good scores whatsoever. the promotions cost about 10 and the entire set looks like it could fall down at any time. why do films like this experience made in the first place? this also had two of the most unified ways i have before come across in the young boy on the spaceship and the redneck from the twentieth century. this film is almost as hardhearted as cool as ice starring the incredibly talented vanilla misunderstood ice.",1,0,97689,0.09615384615384616

169_sememepso,"i was so happy to learn that hari om will finally be theatrically released in 2007. i saw this film three years ago at the vancouver international film festival and have been waiting for it s release ever since so i could mail everyone i know to see it. it s like taking a tumble to india....colorful, unconvincing, thought provoking. aside from one rather strange hollywood style auto rickshaw chase scene this movie is very artless. this is not a bollywood style song and dance movie but it does have drama and romance and humor. the interactions between the indian taxi driver and the french tourist are a good reflection on the fundamental differences between eastern and western life styles and philosophy. the characters are a little broadly drawn but the acting was very good. visually this recital is a treat as you really do get a sense of what driving through rajasthan is like... dreamlike. sometimes it s hard to believe everything you are seeing and experiencing is real... the movie has that same property. terrible soundtrack too!",1,1,148919,0.03910614525139665
